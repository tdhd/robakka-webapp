# Web application for robakka 

This is a basic webapp for robakka () to let a user monitor the game. To install just clone the repo


- `$ git clone https://github.com/tdhd/robakka-webapp.git`
- `$ cd robakka-webapp`
- `$ sbt`
- `> run`

Then just browse to `localhost:9000/game` to let a game start.

The webapp is by no means finished or whatsoever and the way things work might change quite a bit.
